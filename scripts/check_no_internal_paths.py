"""Block internal share paths and dataset identifiers from reaching a public commit.

zarrmony is a public repo; the datasets it is tested against are not. Absolute
paths to lab shares, sample/accession IDs and collaborator names leak
experimental design (what is being stained, in what model, for whom) even when
the surrounding text is purely technical.

Run as a pre-commit hook over staged files. Use placeholders instead:
``/mnt/readonly/<dataset>``, ``$SRC``, ``metadata_<dataset>.json``,
``<main-scene>``.

Add a trailing ``# allow-internal-path`` comment on a line that is a genuine
false positive. Keep those rare — the point is that the reviewer has to look.
