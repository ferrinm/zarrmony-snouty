## [0.1.0] — 2026-07-14

### Added

- Initial release. `SnoutyReader` adapter satisfies zarrmony's `ReaderProtocol`
  and registers as `zarrmony-snouty` via the `zarrmony.readers` entry point.
- **Directory matcher** that fires on subdirectories whose name ends in
  `_ht_sols_snap` or `_ht_sols_acquire` and which contain sibling `data/` +
  `metadata/` subdirs with at least one `.tif` and one `.txt` file.
- **Metadata sidecar parser** for the vendor's `metadata/<name>.txt`
  key=value plaintext (`_metadata.py`), ported from
  `snouty_folder.SnoutyFolder._load_metadata` (see `../snouty-folder` by
  Austin Lefebvre). Uses `ast.literal_eval` instead of the reference's
  `eval` for safe tuple parsing.
- **Raw-skewed reader** (`SnoutyReader`) exposing a `(T=1, C=1, Z, Y, X)`
  dask-backed xarray. Physical pixel sizes are `(X=Y=sample_px_um,
  Z=scan_step_size_um)`. The top 8 rows of every Y slice — the PCO BCD
  timestamp strip — are cropped before the array reaches callers.
- **v0.1 scope guardrails.** Multi-position (`*_pNNNNNN.tif`),
  multi-timepoint (>1 data file, or `volumes_per_buffer > 1`), and
  multi-channel (`channels_per_slice` with >1 entry) acquisitions raise
  `NotImplementedError` subclasses with pointers at the v0.2 tracker.
- **Audit propagation.** The verbatim `.txt` sidecar is exposed via
  `SnoutyReader.metadata` so `zarrmony.convert` writes it to
  `OME/source/raw.snouty.txt`; the reader's `name`, `distribution`, and
  `source = "entry_point"` flow into the audit record.
- **Install-smoke test** confirms the plugin surfaces through
  `zarrmony.readers.plugin.list_plugins()` with the expected provenance.

### Known limitations

- Single position, single timepoint, single channel per conversion.
- Raw skewed output only — no deshear or rotation. Reference implementation
  in [`snouty-folder`](https://github.com/ferrinm/snouty-folder) will be
  ported in v0.2.
- Top-level `*_ht_sols_gui/` GUI-session directory is not yet a matchable
  input; users must convert one `*_ht_sols_*` subdir at a time. Tracked for
  v0.3.
